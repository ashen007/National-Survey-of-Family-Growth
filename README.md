# National Survey of Family Growth

<p style="text-align: justify">The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) gathers information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health. The survey results are used by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and others to plan health services and health education programs, and to do statistical studies of families, fertility, and health.</p>

### Is first babies comes earlier than other babies?

<p style="text-align: justify">compare live first delivery and live other deliveries' pregnancy duration. less likely to early preterm and preterm
deliveries for fist babies and more likely to post term diliveries than other babies(not first baby). term deliveries
also less likely than other babies.</p>

1 - **EARLY PRETERM** (< 34 WEEKS)<br>
2 - **PRETERM** (34-36 WEEKS)<br>
3 - **TERM** (37-40 WEEKS)<br>
4 - **POST-TERM** (> 40WEEKS)

#### cumulative probability

#### probability of each pregnancy length for all pregnancies

### Is first babies comes letter for same mother?

<p style="text-align: justify">most likely in all responds for same mother also have high porbability of in-term delivery. other than all mothers
responds same mother has high probability on early delivery length in first baby. as in all mothers same mother also
have low probability to in-term delivery on first baby other than other babies.</p>

### Is higher income families has higher live births?

![pregnancy and income rate](https://github.com/ashen007/National-Survey-of-Family-Growth/blob/master/Graphs/income_and_parity_counts.jpg)

#### non alive outcomes by income rate

![non-live birth rate](https://github.com/ashen007/National-Survey-of-Family-Growth/blob/master/Graphs/nonlive_pregrate.jpg)

* majority of respondents are in between their 20-30 when they conception and delivery.
* majority of respondents are in between their 30-50 when they interviewed. it's good condition to have because
  respondents have enough time to have multiple pregnancy in her life.
* non alive births are more likely high in high income rate groups than other income rate group.
* only one live birth is more probable in high income groups.

### How pregnancy ended?

![pregnancy number and outcome](https://github.com/ashen007/National-Survey-of-Family-Growth/blob/master/Graphs/pregnum_and_outcome.jpg)

<p style="text-align: justify">more likely to have live birthed and less likely to have dead birth. most of dead births are miscarriages. induced
abortion is second common outcome. non-live outcomes more likely to happen in more than four pregnancy. very few of them
smokes after they knew they were pregnant. most of the smokers smokes 2-4 cigars for a day. more likely to non-live
birth among 15-24 cares smokers and 5-14 cigars smokers. live-births more likely among non-smokers than smokers. and
smoker have more miscarriages than non-smokers.</p>

1 - **LIVE BIRTH**<br>
2 - **INDUCED ABORTION**<br>
3 - **STILL BIRTH**<br>
4 - **MISCARRIAGE**<br>
5 - **ECTOPIC PREGNANCY**<br>
6 - **CURRENT PREGNANCY**
